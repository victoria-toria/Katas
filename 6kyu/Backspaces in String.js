Assume "#" is like a backspace in string. This means that string "a#bc#d" actually is "bd"
Your task is to process a string with "#" symbols.
Examples
"abc#d##c"      ==>  "ac"
"abc##d######"  ==>  ""
"#######"       ==>  ""
""              ==>  ""

    let cleaned = [];
    string.split('').forEach(char => {
        if (char === '#') {
            cleaned.pop();
        } else {
            cleaned.push(char);
        }
    })
    return cleaned.join('');
